    <string name="tags_info_micro_meaning">Micro-transactions are in-game items that the user can purchase using real money. The problem with micro-transactions is that the game difficulty is created in such a way that the player can\'t progress in a reasonable amount of time without paying for said micro-transactions.

    <string name="tags_info_loot_title">What are loot boxes?</string>
    <string name="tags_info_loot_meaning">Loot boxes are micro-transactions with a gambling twist. If you thought spending a lot of money on some in-game items is bad, wait until you have to spend this much money and potentially get nothing in return! Yay!</string>
    <string name="tags_info_p2w_title">What is pay-to-win?</string>
    <string name="tags_info_p2w_meaning">Pay-to-win is a derogatory name for a type of game that implements practices created to make you spend exorbitant amounts of money in order to have a chance at winning the game. Some of those practices were presented above.</string>

    <string name="tags_info_fake_meaning">Fake engagement refers to buying botted positive reviews for a game.</string>
    <string name="tags_info_ad_title">What does \"not as advertised\" mean?</string>
    <string name="tags_info_ad_meaning">When a game is marked with this tag, it means all the promotional art created in order to advertise that game completely misrepresents the final product. Example: a company releases a trailer that makes their game look like it\'s a third person shooter, but in reality, after you download the game expecting what you saw in the trailer, you find out it\'s just a base building game.</string>
    <string name="tags_info_dev_title">What are immoral developers?</string>
    <string name="tags_info_dev_meaning">Immoral developers are those who lie to their community and even steal from them.</string>
    <string name="tags_info_scam_title">What is defined as a scam?</string>
